 <h3>The resason I chose to do this map was to explore how many virtual schools were present in each state in 2019 (before the rise of the COVID pandemic). As you can see, the rates per state were relatively low, but some states (Florida, Michigan) have high levels. It would be interesting to examine how these nubers have changed since COVID-19, and explore if states with more existing virtual school infrastructure handled the transition better.</h3>
