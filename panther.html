 <h2>The question I hoped to answer with this homework was: What is the range of Florida Panthers in Southwest Florida? What risk do major highways and roadkill incidents pose for the species? According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife website, roadkill is a major cause of death for these endangered cats. I used 3 geoprocessing techniques. First, I used dissolve to eliminate the county boundaries in the Florida shapefile (cats dont respect county borders). Then, I used convex hull to make a general range via the telemetry point layer. Finally, I used intersect to highlight the major roads in this range. The resulting map shows several major highways running through panther range, posing a risk to the species. Officials should consider wildlife crossings and rerouting roads.</h2>
