<h4>This map shows the number of people in each county in Massachusetts with disabilities. You will notice that the number of people with disabilities is higher in the counties near the coast and in the middle of the state. These are where population centers occur, driving up these statistics. Massachusetts has an aging population, which gives it relatively higher rates of disability. This information is useful for public health and examining demographic transition. If this data was normalized, we could use it to attempt to find any unusual patterns of disability incidence not related to population as a whole.</h4>
