<h1>Chloropleth- Disabilities in Massachusetts (Health)</h1>
<h2>Michael Dorgan</h2>
 <br>
 <h3> I chose to use this ratio to better express the incidence of disabilities in Massachusetts counties. By expressing disabled population as a function of total population, I account for the variations in population size explaining higher numbers of disabled people. The largest counties in the sample had about 100,000 people, which fit neatly into this function. I have expressed the number of disabled people per 100,000.</h3>
<h2>Classification 1: Natural Breaks</h2>
<h4>Natural breaks classification allows us to see there is a far higher incidence in one county than most others, but relegates most counties to a neutral middle ground that can be difficult to understand.</h4>

 <h2>Classification 2: Equal Counts- Quantile</h2>
 <h4>Equal counts helps ensure that the color distribution is evenly spread between each category, but can be misleading as it makes the color ranges a bit larger for some and smaller for some (compared to Natural Breaks). Can group dissimilar numbers.</h4>

 <h2>Classification 3: Pretty Breaks</h2>
 <h4>Pretty Breaks generally smooths the data from Natural breaks, and thus looks largely similar. The key here is more approachable due to the large round numbers.</h4>
